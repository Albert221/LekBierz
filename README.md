**LekBierz** is a Flutter application developed with few issues in mind:

- people often forget to **take their medicines** when they should
- people often forget whether they **have already taken** their medicines or not
- people sometimes **experience side effects** of taking medicines

This project was started to address those issues and help people with wise drugs dosage, as they were instructed by the doctor or by the contents of a leaflet.

## Features

LekBierz is characterized with some handy features

- It helps you **keep track of the medicines** you are currently taking - with a simple EAN code scanner you can simply scan the barcode on medicine's package to have it in your list in the app.
- It provides you with a simple to use **"diary" of your doses** - every time you take your tabs, just tap the screen to add this fact to your doses history. If you experienced any, you can also write a note about the side effects.
- It **notifies you just in time** your dose should be taken - you can specify how often and at what time your meds should be taken, we'll handle the rest.
- It prevents you from **running out of your pills** - with every new dose added to your history, we know how much you have left.
